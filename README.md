# employee-tracker
  ## Description
 This is a command line application that allows you to view and modify a database of employee records. Functionality includes basic CRUD for individual employee, role, and department records, as well as viewing total department budgets and a list of employees with a specific manager. The inquirer module is used to interface with the program, and the mysql module provides the database connection.

  ## Usage
  Just fork the repository over and clone it down. Enter your database info into the .env file, do an npm init and npm i in the terminal, then node index.js and you should be good to go. I've also included a video if you'd rather not bother with all that.
